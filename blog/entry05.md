# Entry 5

### Context
This month, I've been working towards my goal to Mvp and not much changed throughout this whole process. I added a score tracker so everytime you kill a mob, you get 1 point. It goes till you get 20 points and once you do, the game ends and congratulates you with a YOU WON. You can replay the game if you want and it's a whole loop all over again.
