   I am currently on the last step of the Engineering Design Process. It is communciating the results. I am doing this by showcasing my project for the expo and also the in class presentation where we have to demo our project.

### Content

     5/28 was the day of our expo. We had to be in school by 7:45 to set up and when I got there, I looked for the paper which said where my table number was. I got 21. Then the people start coming in and they was looking at projects. I was pretty nervous about my elevator pitch since I didn't want to mess it up infront of the people. I memorized most of it before hand and when the judge got to me I gave the speech. I first gave my name, details about my project, purpose of the project, how to play it, my inspirations, and then the challenges I had. I feel like my elevator pitch ended a bit to fast. It didn't get past a minute but it was probably around 40 seconds. I feel like I should've elaborated more on the challenges I had. I also noticed I was talking pretty fast and I should've calmed down and took it slower. After that, I had my In Class presentation since I picked 5 . I was the 2nd person of the day to present and it felt awkward going up. During the presentation, I was looking and reading off the slides a lot and not making much eye contact. The eye contact was mostly to one side and not to the other side. The hook was really bad as well. It felt weird saying it and I regret not rehearsing it more. Not only that, I think I should've elaborated more on my project because I feel like I went through it really fast. Overall, I should've rehearsed my slides more. 

### Takeaways ( Elevator Pitch)
* I should've spoken a bit more slower because I was going a bit too fast.
* Add more elaboration on the challenges I had because the speech ended a bit fast.

### Takeaways p2 ( In class Presentation)
* Practice and rehearse the project so I don't need to look back as much and my hook would've probably solded off better.
* I need to make better eye contact because I only focused on one side. I need to focus on everyone and the teacher.
* I should've spent more time talking about my game because I went through it really fast. 


### SKills
* Debugging is really important because there was a code that didn't work and I tried everything, So I asked a friend and it turns out I didn't include the tag in the function.

* Time management is really important but I lacked it because I was rushing on my MVP. I really should stop procrastinating and do my projects earlier.

* Attention to detail is really important because I made sure my slides have no grammar mistakes and also good syntax.
