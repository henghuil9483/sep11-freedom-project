### Content
For these past weeks, I have been learning my tool and trying out new things. For example, I add a really cool background to my game in replit. I also tried adding a player and make it move using WASD. I thought about adding some zombie sprites since I wanna make a zombie shooting game. Thus, I tried moving the sprites by using these lines of code:

``keyPress("space", () => { if (player.grounded()) { player.jump(320); } });``

``keyDown("right", () => { player.move(120, 0); })``

``keyDown("left", () => { player.move(-120, 0); });``

 ### Engineering Design Process
    


 ### Skills

* Attention to detail: This skill is very important because the slight misplacement of a bracket or mispelling of a word can mess up the code
* How to google: I am trying to get better at this skill because I want to search what I want quicker and faster
* Debugging: Again, I'm using this skill to tinker with code and correct my mistakes
