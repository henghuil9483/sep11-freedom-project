### Content
For these past weeks, I have been learning my tool and trying out new things. I watched some videos on Youtube that showed Kaboom Tutorials and how to make a better game. What I did so far was added a really cool background to my game in replit. I also tried adding a player and make it move using WASD. I thought about adding some zombie sprites since I wanna make a zombie shooting game. I scrolled around Kaboom.Js and saw ways to make the sprite move so I tried it out. Thus, I tried moving the sprites by using these lines of code:

``keyPress("space", () => { if (player.grounded()) { player.jump(320); } });``

``keyDown("right", () => { player.move(120, 0); })``

``keyDown("left", () => { player.move(-120, 0); });``

For context, the first code above is to make the sprite jump when you press spacebar and the last 2 codes allow you to move the sprite left and right. Next up, I want to add a in game weapon for the player so it can attack the mobs and get points for killing it. That will be my goal for the month.

Video was really helpful in teaching how to add a background and others

 ### Engineering Design Process
    Last time, I was on steps 2 and 3, Researching the problem and Brainstorming possible solutions. Currently, I am still Brainstorming possible solutions to make my game more unique. I am also researching a problem of how to add a weapon for the player to attack the mobs with. The next step will be planning a promising solution. That will be achieved when I put the code together and have a functioning game. 


 ### Skills

* Attention to detail: This skill is very important because the slight misplacement of a bracket or mispelling of a word can mess up the code
* How to google: I am trying to get better at this skill because I want to search what I want quicker and faster
* Debugging: Again, I'm using this skill to tinker with code and correct my mistakes
