### Content
For these past weeks, I have been learning my tool and trying out new things. I watched some videos on Youtube that showed Kaboom Tutorials and how to make a better game. What I did so far was added a really cool background to my game in replit. I also tried adding a player and make it move using WASD. I thought about adding some zombie sprites since I wanna make a zombie shooting game. I scrolled around Kaboom.Js and saw ways to make the sprite move so I tried it out. Thus, I tried moving the sprites by using these lines of code:

``keyPress("space", () => { if (player.grounded()) { player.jump(320); } });``

``keyDown("right", () => { player.move(120, 0); })``

``keyDown("left", () => { player.move(-120, 0); });``

For context, the first code above is to make the sprite jump when you press spacebar and the last 2 codes allow you to move the sprite left and right. Next up, I want to add a in game weapon for the player so it can attack the mobs and get points for killing it. That will be my goal for the month.

 ### Engineering Design Process
    


 ### Skills

* Attention to detail: This skill is very important because the slight misplacement of a bracket or mispelling of a word can mess up the code
* How to google: I am trying to get better at this skill because I want to search what I want quicker and faster
* Debugging: Again, I'm using this skill to tinker with code and correct my mistakes
