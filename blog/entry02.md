 ### Engineering Design Process
    


 ### Skills

* Attention to detail: This skill is very important because the slight misplacement of a bracket or mispelling of a word can mess up the code
* How to google: I am trying to get better at this skill because I want to search what I want quicker and faster
* Debugging: Again, I'm using this skill to tinker with code and correct my mistakes
