### Content
 The tool I decide on was Kaboom.Js . I picked this tool because I want to make a game based platform such as a zombie shooter game or a bootleg flappy bird game. I first tinkered with it by inputting the script src code to my html file. Then I needed an canvas for the project. So it was between putting <canvas id="game"></canvas> or going to replit.com to do it. Luckily, replit had an inbuilt kaboom file that you can create, and it came with the template of the background and a green frog. I tried inputting some effects to the mouse when everytime I click, an certain effect will pop out. For example, everytime I click, there is the Kaboom effect and Im trying to make it the KO POW effect. I also tinkered by adding new other sprites in my game by using Const add.

 ### Engineering Design Process
 The process I am doing right now is brainstorming for more solutions as my game doesn't have much code right now. I am also researching the problem because I'm still trying to add new code to my game. For example, making the spirtes having health bars.


 ### Skills

 * Debugging:I'm using this skill because I'm tinkering around with codes so I can make my game more unique and more fun.
 * Growth mindset:This is because I am still trying to grow and make my game progress and better
 * Creativity: This is an important skill because I am trying to make a game thats unique and unlike other games.
